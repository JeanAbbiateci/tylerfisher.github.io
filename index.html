        <section class="content"><h6>Note: This article was originally published on <a href="https://medium.com/p/d73c2573c254">Medium</a></h6>
<p>Recently, a lot of people that I admire and look up to have raised their voices, advocating for getting the Internet back to <a href="http://dashes.com/anil/2012/12/the-web-we-lost.html">what it once was</a>. <a href="https://the-pastry-box-project.net/erin-kissane/2013-december-25">An open web</a>. <a href="https://twitter.com/monteiro/status/416746630696558592">A web we shared</a> and owned together. The old web was <a href="https://twitter.com/dansinker/status/416737758598529024">awesome</a>.</p>
<p>It sure sounds awesome. Currently, our networks and our personal data are controlled by major corporations with no respect for privacy. Silicon Valley, that so-called tech hotbed of “innovation” and “disruption,” is by most reports becoming a culture of <a href="http://www.npr.org/series/251652256/income-inequality-in-the-san-francisco-bay-area">inequality</a> and <a href="http://valleywag.gawker.com/paul-graham-says-women-havent-been-hacking-for-the-pa-1490581236?rev=1388186389">vapidity</a>. Getting back to the founding open standards the web is, I’m told, a solution to all of this. The web should be a place where we can own our data, where our best developers focus on solving the problems we need to solve as a democratic society. An open web accepts all people and creates a culture of&nbsp;inclusion.</p>
<p>Again, sounds great. As a webmaker, I want an open web. But as someone who has never experienced that, I don’t know where to begin in making it. I’m not sure simply reverting back to what we had is the right path if we want to include people who have never experienced the open web or understand its&nbsp;principles.</p>

<p>I had a Xanga in middle school, and I wrote a bunch of bad music criticism on various music blogs in high school, but I wasn’t cognizant enough to recognize what else was out there or understand what the web meant. I was a user of the web as I am now: I used services made by large companies so they could control my content. From Xanga to <span class="caps">AOL</span> Instant Messenger to MySpace to Facebook to Twitter, my main modes of participation on the web have been through major web corporations seeking to own my data and sell it to advertisers. Back then, I didn’t know any better. Now, it seems like I don’t have much of a&nbsp;choice.</p>
<p>Aside from the music criticism, my story is not unique. I know this because I used all of these products to communicate with my friends. For my generation — you know, the dreaded Millenials — the Internet has been about networking, about telling everyone about what is happening to you at any given moment. And as we age and our lives take different paths, we can stay in touch. This is the promise that the social web kept. We do not lack for ways of staying in touch, no matter the distance. Better yet, we’re pretty good at using these networks! We’ve become adept users of the&nbsp;web.</p>
<p><a href="http://thescoop.org/archives/2013/10/01/the-natives-arent-restless-enough/">But we don’t know how to make these networks</a>. We, as a generation, do not know how the web works or how to make it. More importantly, I don’t think my generation cares about knowing how the web works, as long as someone else is making it work. Hell, I know how the web works, but I’m still writing my post <a href="https://medium.com/p/d73c2573c254">on Medium</a>, where I control next-to-nothing, instead of my personal site, where I control everything, because it is easier and hopefully more people will see it. If we don’t care about how the web works, how can we understand why it is important to own our data? Why would we try if what we can do now is so&nbsp;easy?</p>

<p>When we talk about getting the open web back, let’s not forget the openness that comes from ease and power for the end user that we’ve created in the past few years. I’ve been around for conversations where more experienced webmakers talk about how they used to publish their content or put up their data servers. They owned all that data, and man, those were the days, but to me it sounded awful. <a href="http://dashes.com/anil/2012/12/the-web-we-lost.html">Anil Dash reminisces</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the early days of the social web, there was a broad expectation that regular people might own their own identities by having their own websites, instead of being dependent on a few big sites to host their online identity. In this vision, you would own your own domain name and have complete control over its contents, rather than having a handle tacked on to the end of a <a href="http://dashes.com/anil/2009/06/the-future-of-facebook-usernames.html">huge company’s site</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Are we suggesting everyone needs their own personal website and domain name on the open web? I understand the benefit of having a personal site — that’s why I have one — but everyone? That’s a tough sell. Making a Tumblr to do the same thing is so much easier. Anil’s follow-up post on how to rebuild the open web is smart: It acknowledges that the <span class="caps">UX</span> gains we’ve made on the social web are not to be forgotten. But we also have to acknowledge that not everyone wants in on this greater individual investment on the web. Some people will want to be passive users. We have to acknowledge that this is&nbsp;okay.</p>
<p>The open web of the past — at least, the one I’m told about — had its own barrier to entry: You had to care about your data and understand why it was important to own all of it. That’s not going to work this time around. People who have grown up not caring about owning their content and identity online are not going to start caring all of a sudden. Snapchat is successful for a&nbsp;reason.</p>
<p>We do need to fight and make the web more open. I do not deny this; indeed, I fully support the cause. But we need to think about what is going to work at the next stage of the Internet. What will create the most inclusive future? After all, it was our old open web that gave rise to our new social&nbsp;web.</p>
<p>Instead of reminiscing about how great the old open web was, yearning to go back to that, let’s talk about the present&nbsp;questions:</p>
<p>How can we assure users of the web that their data and identities are safe online?
How can we get social content back into the hands of its creators?
How do we include everyone?
I don’t pretend to have all the answers, but here is a crucial aspect: web services cannot exploit the general user’s ignorance about the web. Even if users do not care about owning their data or understand what owning their data means, the web service cannot take advantage of that and sell their data. This is where the social web has failed us. The social web has exploited the ignorance of the average user of the web for&nbsp;profit.</p>
<p>The important step forward is that, while users own their data, they do not need to know what to do with it. The future open web must be easier to use than the current social web, and knowing what to do with your own data cannot be a prerequisite. We will have passive users of the web, and the web needs them. If we exclude them, we risk creating a walled garden that lacks the perspectives and experiences of different types of people. <a href="https://the-pastry-box-project.net/mike-monteiro/2013-december-18">Where have we heard that&nbsp;before?</a></p>

        <h1><a href="/articles/data_literacy/">For journalists, web literacy is not quite enough</a></h1>
        <p class="date"><span>10.26.2013</span></p>
        <section class="content"><h6>Note: This was originally published on the <a href="http://knightlab.northwestern.edu/2013/10/27/mozfest-2013-for-journalists-web-literacy-is-not-quite-enough/" target="_blank">Knight Lab&nbsp;blog</a></h6>
<p>One of Mozfest&#39;s most prominent themes this year has been “Build + Teach the Web.” Throughout the keynotes and sessions, Mozilla has pushed its new initiative, <a href="https://webmaker.org/en">Webmaker</a>, as a rallying point for all of us interested in educating the world in becoming creators of the web rather than&nbsp;users.</p>
<p>It&#39;s a great initiative. Nothing is more important for us as makers than getting more people onboard, especially in journalism. But journalism has a specific set of requirements that make teaching the web a much different and arguably much more difficult&nbsp;task.</p>
<p>Perhaps the best of Webmaker&#39;s current available resources is its attempt at a <a href="https://webmaker.org/en-US/standard">Web Literacy Standard</a>. It divides web literacy into three “strands”: Exploring, Building and Connecting. Each of these three strands have subsections, such as “Composing for the Web” under Building or “Open Practices” under Connecting. Everything in the standard is relevant and necessary for making the&nbsp;web.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it&#39;s not enough for journalists. I have said often that journalists do not need expert programming skills; they just need web literacy. Now, upon seeing the most complete attempt at defining just what web literacy means, journalists still need yet another type of literacy: data&nbsp;literacy.</p>
<p>This does not mean statistics, or at least not the predictive statistics that you may come across in an academic statistics department. Journalists largely deal with populations, not samples. When we deal with data, we generally deal with all of it. More and more, everyday journalists need to deal with this&nbsp;data.</p>
<p>What would a data literacy standard look like? I hope to create a more complete attempt in the near future, but data literacy as it relates to the web requires at least a few skills that come to&nbsp;mind:</p>
<ol>
<li>Working with spreadsheets. Often data comes in a format that lends itself to a spreadsheet. Journalists need to know not only how to read and write in them, but also how to crunch some numbers and transform the data to find the story in&nbsp;datasets.</li>
<li>Web scraping. Too much data is not released in a usable format, and it too often takes web scraping skills to extract it. More difficult tasks will always be handled by news devs, but empowering journalists with basic web scraping skills will empower newsrooms to deal with more&nbsp;data.</li>
<li>Data cleaning. Data is never perfect and often filthy. Journalists need to know what to do about it, or any data project they do will be misleading and&nbsp;incorrect.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is far from a complete list of data skills that journalists need. But that list also does not exist in any concise format (certainly, the <a href="http://datajournalismhandbook.org/">Data Journalism Handbook</a> is a great longform resource), and if we want to emphasize to working and future journalists the skills they need, we need something concrete to point to. For web skills, Mozilla&#39;s Web Literacy Standard is a great resource and starting point. But journalists need to consider what data skills we all need.

        <p class="date"><span>08.02.2013</span></p>
        <section class="content"><h6>Note: This was originally published on the <a href="http://knightlab.northwestern.edu/2013/08/02/how-to-portfolio-sites-for-journalists-github-makes-em-cheap-and-kinda-easy/" target="_blank">Knight Lab blog</a>.</h6>
<p>Time and time again, new journalists are told to market themselves and make a brand for themselves. The new media heroes of the day have all done it — Nate Silver and his <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/">fivethirtyeight</a> brand, Andrew Sullivan and <a href="http://dish.andrewsullivan.com/">The Daily Dish</a>, Brian Stelter and <a href="http://www.mediabistro.com/tvnewser/">TVNewser</a>, <a href="http://www.mthomps.com/">Matt Thompson</a>, <a href="http://katchow.com/">Kat Chow</a>, <a href="http://toure.com/">Touré</a>, <a href="http://about.me/danyelsmith">Danyel Smith</a> — the list goes on. Sometimes, though, all you need a static site to tell people who you are and what you do. You need a portfolio&nbsp;site.</p>
<p>The only problem is that hosting a website is hard work. Just registering a domain name requires navigating a labyrinth of menus and navigation bars designed in the early 2000s that do more to confuse than inform. And for those looking to host full blogs on WordPress or other platforms, it requires syncing a web host to a domain registrar, which can get even more&nbsp;confusing.</p>
<p>In Medill, students are instructed early to buy their own domain name and install a WordPress blog on it. While Medill has a special promotion with Dreamhost to lower the cost of entry for hosting for the first few months, many students drop their hosting plan when the cost becomes too expensive. Yet when internship and job application season comes around, they want a portfolio site to show off their&nbsp;work.</p>
<p>Many turn back to WordPress and Dreamhost hosting, paying upwards of $10 per month to host what is essentially a static page on slow servers running WordPress. If the site does work, it is way too heavy for serving the purpose of linking readers to all of that student&#39;s work elsewhere on the web. Most times, a simple, static site will serve that purpose just fine. In fact, my own <a href="http://www.tylerjfisher.com/">website</a> is&nbsp;static. </p>
<p>What if I told you that, if you code your own website, you could host it <em>for free</em> on a much faster, reliable platform than Dreamhost? Hosting your website on <a href="http://www.github.com/">GitHub</a>, the collaborative coding platform, not only provides free static hosting through GitHub Pages, but also encourages you to learn how to code properly using version&nbsp;control.</p>
