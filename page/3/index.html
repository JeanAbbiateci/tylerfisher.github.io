        <section class="content"><h6>Note: This was originally published on the <a href="http://knightlab.northwestern.edu/2013/02/05/what-j-schools-can-learn-from-music-conservatories-compj/" target="_blank">Knight Lab&nbsp;blog</a></h6>
<p>Was Computation + Journalism an academic conference or an industry conference? It&#39;s hard to say, especially when nearly every panel through its two days featured a working journalist and an educator, and an equally diverse audience pressed questions from many ends of the field. Unsurprisingly, the debates that came to the fore early and often centered around that intersection between educators and practicing journalists. As a student in a journalism school, I paid special attention to the discussion around what students should be learning in journalism school to prepare them for becoming a practicing&nbsp;journalist.</p>

        <p class="date"><span>11.01.2012</span></p>
        <section class="content"><p>About six months ago, I started using <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown">Markdown</a> to take notes in class, to write essays, to keep track of meetings, to make project to-do lists — for just about everything. Markdown is the reason I chose to use <a href="http://scriptogr.am/">Scriptogr.am</a> for this blog. People who see my screen in a class often ask what I‘m doing, and I’ve been recognized elsewhere as “the kid who codes his notes.” It&#39;s really not that scary. I think Markdown is for everyone. So this is an explainer on how I switched my written life to Markdown, and an argument for why more people, especially journalists, should do&nbsp;so.</p>
