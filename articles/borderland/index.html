      <h1>How We Built Borderland Out Of A Spreadsheet</h1>
      <p class="date"><span>04.22.2014</span></p>
      <section class="content"><h6>Note: This was originally published on the <a href="http://blog.apps.npr.org/2014/04/23/how-we-built-borderland-out-of-a-spreadsheet.html" target="_blank"><span class="caps">NPR</span> Visuals&nbsp;blog</a></h6>
<p>Since the <span class="caps">NPR</span> News Apps team merged with the Multimedia team, now known as the Visuals team, we&#39;ve been working on different types of projects. <a href="http://apps.npr.org/tshirt">Planet Money Makes a T-Shirt</a> was the first real “Visuals” project, and since then, we&#39;ve been telling more stories that are driven by photos and video such as <a href="http://apps.npr.org/wolves">Wolves at the Door</a> and <a href="http://apps.npr.org/grave-science">Grave Science</a>. <a href="http://apps.npr.org/borderland">Borderland</a> is the most recent visual story we have built, and its size and breadth required us to develop a smart process for handling a huge variety of&nbsp;content. </p>
<p><span class="more"></span></p>
<p>Borderland is a giant slide deck. 129 slides, to be exact. Within those slides, we tell 12 independent stories about the U.S.-Mexico border. Some of these stories are told <a href="http://apps.npr.org/borderland/#_/empty-houses">in photos</a>, some are told <a href="http://apps.npr.org/borderland/#_/apprehension">in text</a>, some are told <a href="http://apps.npr.org/borderland/#_/drawing-the-line">in maps</a> and some are told <a href="http://apps.npr.org/borderland/#_/junior">in video</a>. Managing all of this varying content coming from writers, photographers, editors and cartographers was a challenge, and one that made editing an <span class="caps">HTML</span> file directly impossible. Instead, we used <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AlXMOHKxzQVRdGN6cHM2WFJpZ2pvRVpxM3JqNkUyMlE&amp;usp=sharing#gid=1">a spreadsheet</a> to manage all of our&nbsp;content.</p>
<p><img src="/articles/borderland/spreadsheet.jpg" alt="A screenshot of our content spreadsheet"></p>
<p>On Monday, the team released <a href="http://github.com/nprapps/copytext">copytext.py</a>, a Python library for accessing spreadsheets as native Python objects so that they can be used for templating. Copytext, paired with our Flask-driven <a href="http://github.com/nprapps/app-template">app template</a>, allows us to use Google Spreadsheets as a lightweight <span class="caps">CMS</span>. You can read the fine details about how we set that up in the Flask app <a href="http://blog.apps.npr.org/2014/04/21/introducing-copytext-py.html">here</a>, but for now, know that we have a global <code>COPY</code> object accessible to our templates that is filled with the data from a Google&nbsp;Spreadsheet.</p>
<p>In the Google Spreadsheet project, we can create multiple sheets. For Borderland, our most important sheet was the <code>content</code> sheet, shown above. Within that sheet lived all of the text, images, background colors and more. The most important column in that sheet, however, is the first one, called <code>template</code>. The template column is filled with the name of a corresponding Jinja2 template we create in our project repo. For example, a row where the <code>template</code> column has a value of “slide” will be rendered with the “slide.html”&nbsp;template.</p>
<p>We do this with some simple looping in our <a href="https://github.com/nprapps/borders-map/blob/master/templates/index.html">index.html</a>&nbsp;file:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/TylerFisher/11218882.js"> </script>

<p>In this loop, we search for a template matching the value of each row&#39;s <code>template</code> column. If we find one, we render the row&#39;s content through that template. If it is not found (for example, in the first row of the spreadsheet, where we set column headers), then we skip the row thanks to <code>ignore missing</code>. We can access all of that row&#39;s content and render the content in any way we&nbsp;like.</p>
<p>Let‘s look at a specific example. Here’s row 28 of our&nbsp;spreadsheet.</p>
<p><img src="/articles/borderland/row.jpg" alt="Row 28"></p>
<p>It is given the slide template, and has both text and an image associated with it. Jinja recognizes this template slug and passes the row to the <code>slide.html</code> template.</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/TylerFisher/11218917.js"> </script>

<p>There&#39;s a lot going on here, but note that the text column is placed within the <code>full-block-content</code> div, and the image is set in the <code>data-bgimage</code> attribute in the container div, which we use for lazy-loading our assets at the correct&nbsp;time.</p>
<p>The result is <a href="http://apps.npr.org/borderland/#_/25">slide 25</a>:</p>
<p><img src="/articles/borderland/slide.jpg" alt="Slide 25"></p>
<p>Looping through each row of our spreadsheet like this is extremely powerful. It allow us to create arbitrary reusable templates for each of our projects. In Borderland, the vast majority of our rows were <code>slide</code> templates. However, the <a href="http://apps.npr.org/borderland/#_/36">“What&#39;s It Like”</a> section of the project required a different treatment in the template markup to retain both readability of the quotations and visibiilty of the images. So we created a new template, called <a href="https://github.com/nprapps/borders-map/blob/master/templates/slide-big-quote.html">slide-big-quote</a> to deal with those&nbsp;issues. </p>
<p>Other times, we didn‘t need to alter the markup; we just needed to style particular aspects of a slide differently. That’s why we have an <code>extra_class</code> column that allows us to tie classes to particular rows and style them properly in our <span class="caps">LESS</span> file. For example, we gave many slides within the <a href="http://apps.npr.org/borderland/#_/words">“Words”</a> section the class <code>word-pair</code> to handle the treatment of the text in this section. Rather than write a whole new template, we wrote a <a href="https://github.com/nprapps/borders-map/blob/master/less/app.less#L1187">little bit of <span class="caps">LESS</span></a> to handle the&nbsp;treatment. </p>
<p><img src="/articles/borderland/words.jpg" alt="Words"></p>
<p>More importantly, the spreadsheet separated concerns among our team well. Content producers never had to do more than write some rudimentary <span class="caps">HTML</span> for each slide in the cell of the spreadsheet, allowing them to focus on editorial voice and flow. Meanwhile, the developers and designers could focus on the templating and functionality as the content evolved in the spreadsheet. We were able to iterate quickly and play with many different treatments of our content before settling on the final&nbsp;product.</p>
<p>Using a spreadsheet as a lightweight <span class="caps">CMS</span> is certainly an imperfect solution to a difficult problem. Writing multiple lines of HTML in a spreadsheet cell is an unfriendly interface, and relying on Google to synchronize our content seems tenuous at best (though we do create a local .xlsx file with a Fabric command instead of relying on Google for development). But for us, this solution makes the most sense. By making our content modular and templatable, we can iterate over design solutions quickly and effectively and allow our content producers to be directly involved in the process of storytelling on the&nbsp;web.</p>
