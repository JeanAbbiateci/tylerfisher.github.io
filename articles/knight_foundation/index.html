      <h1>Restoring Equilibrium to the Web</h1>
      <p class="date"><span>03.12.2014</span></p>
      <section class="content"><h6>Note: This was originally published on the <a href="http://www.knightfoundation.org/blogs/knightblog/2014/3/13/restoring-equilibrium-web/" target="_blank">Knight Foundation&nbsp;blog</a></h6>
<p><em>In June, Knight Foundation will award $2.75 million, including $250,000 from the Ford Foundation, to support the most compelling ideas around the News Challenge question: How can we strengthen the Internet for free expression and innovation? To submit an application or to provide feedback on other entries, visit newschallenge.org. The deadline is 5 p.m. <span class="caps">ET</span> on March&nbsp;18.</em></p>
<p>This question, how can we strengthen the Internet for free expression and innovation, should not have to be asked. From its inception, the web’s creators designed it as an open medium for free expression and innovation. In Nieman Lab’s sprawling <em>Riptide</em>, Tim Berners-Lee reminisces on why he invented the whole thing in the first&nbsp;place:</p>
<p>“Every time you thought of something, then you’d put it [on the web], and I’d pretty much see it, so that you and I, our brains, would be in equilibrium, because we’d be in equilibrium with the&nbsp;web.”</p>
<p>Equilibrium is the key word: all ideas and people were balanced in Berners-Lee’s original concept of the web. But if you ask him about today’s version of the web, as Wired <span class="caps">UK</span> did in February, his tone is&nbsp;different:</p>
<p>“I want a web that&#39;s open, works internationally, works as well as possible and is not nation-based. […] What I don‘t want is a web where the Brazilian government has every social network’s data stored on servers on Brazilian&nbsp;soil.”</p>
<p>When the inventor’s description of the state of the invention contradicts the intention, something went wrong. Berners-Lee seems primarily concerned with government spying and control of the web, not the monopolization of the web by major tech companies. But both are major&nbsp;problems.</p>
<p>Even if we achieve a decentralization of the web and reclaim personal privacy, younger users of the web — my generation — won’t know how to use it. We grew with a centralized web. MySpace, <span class="caps">AOL</span> Instant Messenger, Facebook, Gmail — these services weaned us and provided us everything we needed. Why would we&nbsp;leave?</p>
<p>So, how do we get younger users of the web to <em>understand the importance</em> of a decentralized web that strengthens free expression and&nbsp;innovation?</p>
<p>It’s not about making the best <span class="caps">WYSIWYG</span> tool out there. Making decentralized services that are actually a pleasure to use is a great goal, but creating a population of the web that understands why these services are important matters&nbsp;more.</p>
<p>The answer to the Knight News Challenge’s question is about education. But the answer should not — cannot — be creating a population of the web that can code. This is a deeper, harder problem than that. Plenty of talented programmers do not understand the importance of a decentralized web. Indeed, many of them built the companies and government programs that have torn it all&nbsp;down.</p>
<p>We have lost the equilibrium of ideas that Berners-Lee imagined when he invented the web. Some voices tip the scales and matter more than others. Today, those more powerful voices do not care about the freedoms of the individual, and the individual doesn’t know how to fight&nbsp;back.</p>
<p>This fight is about empowerment. It’s about bringing more than just the privileged onto the web as equal citizens. It’s about fostering a community of understanding. It’s about a community of makers instead of users (no, that does not <em>just</em> mean coding). And it’s about so, so much more than&nbsp;this.</p>
<p>I look forward to seeing proposals that seek to decentralize the web by empowering individuals, especially the underprivileged and powerless. It’s not about taking back the open web. It’s about creating a new one where everyone is&nbsp;included.</p>
