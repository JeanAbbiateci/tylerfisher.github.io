# A fundamental way newspaper sites (still) need to change

In 2006, Adrian Holovaty wrote an essay called [“A fundamental way newspaper sites need to change.”](http://www.holovaty.com/writing/fundamental-change/) It, in many ways, predicted (and perhaps inspired) the web-focused data journalism revolution that has risen at the world’s largest publications over the past half-decade. (That’s not to say data journalism didn’t exist before, but it has more prominence as publications shift to a web-first focus). 

But as 2014 begins, seven-and-a-half years after Holovaty’s writing, it feels like the changes he called for have not been as _fundamental_ as he envisioned. Specifically, newspapers still hold the “story-centric worldview” that forces them to step away from focusing on the data and key bits of information behind the life of the town, city or nation that they cover.

Holovaty was right in 2006, but a lot has changed since then, not only in journalism but also in the structure and abilities of the web. While Holovaty’s desire to move from the story-centric world view was prescient, I think it proves useful to brainstorm what this might look like in 2014 and beyond.

What is the value of a newspaper? In democratic regimes, the value is clear: a free press means a free people. It is the institution that brings accountability to our government. 

But that’s not all. A good newspaper that focuses on a location—a city, a town, a state, a country—knows that place better than any other institution.
